This is an interpreter written in Go to "interpret" a madeup language called the Monkey Programming language.
This project follows Thorsten Bell's book "Writing an interpreter in Go".
Expressed as a list of features, Monkey has the following:
• C-like syntax
• variable bindings
• integers and booleans
• arithmetic expressions
• built-in functions
• first-class and higher-order functions • closures
• a string data structure
• an array data structure
• a hash data structure

The interpreter will have the following parts:
• the lexer
• the parser
• the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) 
• the internal object system
• the evaluator
